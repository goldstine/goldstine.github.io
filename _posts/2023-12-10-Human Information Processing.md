### Introduction
With the increasing integration of technology in modern vehicles, it is critical to understand and solve the information processing problems that arise during the interaction between humans and vehicle systems. Successfully integrating autonomous vehicles into transportation systems requires addressing several challenges, including the design of effective human-machine interface (HMI) systems. This literature review will explore the current state of research on HMI design for autonomous vehicles, identify issues and challenges, and propose potential solutions.

### Part 1: Literature Review and Identify Problems

#### 1.1 Literature review
The development of automated cars has been a topic of interest for researchers and engineers for several decades. The potential benefits of automated cars include increased safety, reduced traffic congestion, and improved fuel efficiency. However, the successful integration of automated cars into the transportation system requires addressing several challenges, including the design of effective Human Machine Interface (HMI) systems.

Several studies have investigated the design of HMI systems for automated cars. One study by Carsten and Hagenzieker (2019) proposed design principles for in-vehicle HMI systems, including the need for clear and concise information, intuitive interfaces, and effective communication between the driver and the automated system. Another study by Stanton et al. (2018) highlighted the importance of designing HMI systems that are adaptable to different driving scenarios and driver preferences.

Despite the progress made in HMI design for automated cars, several challenges remain. One challenge is the potential for driver disengagement from the driving task. Automated cars may lead to a false sense of security, causing drivers to become complacent and less attentive to the road. This problem is compounded by the fact that automated cars may require drivers to take over control of the vehicle in certain situations, such as when the automated system encounters an unexpected obstacle.


#### 1.2 Problems
Based on the literature review, several problems can be identified in the design of HMI systems for automated cars. These problems include:
1. Driver disengagement from the driving task due to a false sense of security provided by the automated system.
2. Driver confusion and misunderstanding of the automated system due to non-standardized interfaces and symbols.
3. The potential for drivers to become overwhelmed by the amount of information presented by the HMI system.
4. The need for HMI systems to be adaptable to different driving scenarios and driver preferences.
5. The potential for drivers to become complacent and less attentive to the road, leading to safety concerns. 
Addressing these problems will require further research and development in the design of HMI systems for automated cars. Standardization of interfaces and symbols, as well as the development of adaptable and intuitive HMI systems, will be crucial in ensuring the safe and effective integration of automated.

### Part 2: Design Implications for Resolving the Phenomenon

#### 2.1 Solving these problems --- Standardized HMI designing. 
One design implication to solve the problem of driver confusion and misunderstanding of automated systems due to non-standardized interfaces and symbols is to implement a standardized HMI design framework. The framework will establish guidelines for the design of HMI systems for autonomous vehicles, including the use of standardized symbols and interfaces. The framework will be developed through collaboration between industry stakeholders including automakers, technology companies and regulators.

Driver confusion and misunderstanding of automated systems due to non-standardized interfaces and symbols is a significant issue in autonomous vehicle development. Self-driving cars may use different symbols and interfaces than traditional cars, causing driver confusion and frustration. Additionally, a lack of standardization in HMI design for autonomous vehicles could lead to a proliferation of different approaches, further complicating drivers’ understanding of the system. A standardized HMI design framework will address this issue by establishing design guidelines for autonomous automotive HMI systems.

A standardized HMI design framework will establish guidelines for the design of HMI systems for autonomous vehicles. The framework will include guidelines for the use of standardized symbols and interfaces, as well as guidelines for the layout and organization of information displayed by HMIs. The framework will be developed through collaboration between industry stakeholders including automakers, technology companies and regulators.

A standardized HMI design framework will include guidelines for the use of standardized symbols and interfaces. These guidelines will ensure that the symbols and interfaces used in autonomous vehicle HMI systems are consistent across different models and manufacturers. This will help reduce driver confusion and frustration and improve their understanding of automated systems.

A standardized HMI design framework will also include guidelines for the layout and organization of HMI display information. These guidelines will ensure that information provided to drivers is clear, concise, and easy to understand. The layout and organization of information is designed to minimize the driver's cognitive load and enhance their cognitive abilities.


#### 2.2 Use of Figures and Demonstrations
To demonstrate the importance of standardized HMI design, Figure 1 provides a simplified model of the most important concepts. The figure shows that if the reliability of technical systems increases, it benefits both comfort and trust, both of which increase. However, response times also increase, and automation introduces surprises, all with potential negative security impacts. Note that as system reliability increases, automation surprises will occur less frequently, but the impact will be more severe when they occur. Situational awareness and vigilance (attention) are reduced, as is trust calibration.

Figure 1 highlights the importance of balancing technical system reliability with human factors issues such as negligence and trust. The figure shows that increasing system reliability can increase comfort and trust, but can also lead to negative security impacts, such as increased response times and automation surprises. This demonstrates the need for a standardized HMI design framework that considers both technical and human factors to ensure safe and effective collaboration between human drivers and autonomous vehicles.

In summary, using graphics and demonstrations is an effective way to illustrate the importance of standardized HMI design for safe and effective collaboration between human drivers and autonomous vehicles. Figures 1 illustrates the need for a standardized HMI design framework that considers technical and human factors and establishes usage guidelines for symbols and interfaces to ensure driver consistency and clarity.

#### 2.3 A New Direction – Minimalist Design
According to Julia Kindelsberger, Lex Fridman, Michael Glazer           &Bryan Reimer (2018), minimalist design is a design approach that starts from the ground up, adding only the absolute minimum necessary to create a safe and enjoyable driving experience. The authors propose that this approach can create a more spacious and elegant interior while still providing the driver with necessary information.

To achieve a minimalist design of a vehicle HMI, this article proposes a design decision-making process that begins with asking “why?” rather than “why not?” when selecting what information to add to the vehicle HMI. The authors believe that this approach can help designers avoid adding unnecessary information and instead focus on the absolute minimum required to create a safe and enjoyable driving experience.

The paper also proposes a fully software-controlled HMI, giving automotive engineers and designers the power and freedom to continuously innovate. The authors believe that continuous data collection can enable personalized vehicle customization based on driver-specific behavioral information collected in the vehicle.

Overall, the minimalist design of the vehicle HMI results in a safe, beautiful, and satisfying driving experience. By starting from scratch and adding only the absolute minimum necessary to create a safe and enjoyable driving experience, designers can avoid overwhelming the driver with unnecessary information.
#### 2.4 HMI Design Principles

>HMI design steps and best practices

##### 2.4.1.Reduce visual load
The process of users identifying and searching for information on the screen is considered visual load. Drivers often use HMI while driving. User attention management is very necessary to reduce traffic accidents caused by distraction. Therefore, it is particularly important to quickly identify and find the content the user wants. We can reduce the operating load by Follow a few principles.

**Efficient browsing:** When setting information levels, drivers can set information more quickly. This can be achieved through contrasting design techniques to ensure that drivers can have efficient browsing while driving and reduce driver safety. visual capture cost

**3-second principle:** User attention management is very necessary to reduce traffic accidents caused by distraction. During driving, necessary operations need to follow the 3-second principle. Users must find the key information and function entrances of the application scenario within the first second. , then perform interactive actions in the 2nd second, and finally get the desired information result in the 3rd second. Accurately grasp the time in each process, eliminate interference from unnecessary elements, and avoid distracting attention.

**Information visualization principles:** The practice of presenting data in an intuitive way with clear meaning, making it interpretable and easy for users to understand. This includes data visualization and dashboards. For non-experts, information visualization is an effective way to share insights in an easy-to-understand form.

##### 2.4.2 Reduce operating load
When driving, the driver should try to keep the operation path as short as possible. If the operation is too complicated and there are too many steps, he may give up midway. This is the impact of action load.

**Quick response:** Drivers often perform interface operations during driving. For the safety of drivers, operations should be easier, such as prominently used functions and short operation paths.

**Timely feedback:** In actual driving scenarios, we are faced with complex road condition information, which needs to be immediately fed back to our drivers through vision, design, sound, etc.

**Silent interaction:** Silent interaction is quietly integrated into our daily use, without much thinking or special attention. As a tool, the car and engine should not become the center of attention of the driver and steal his attention. In future designs, allowing users to focus on “tasks” rather than tools is the ultimate destination of in-vehicle HMI interaction.

**Voice interaction:** Voice interaction can quickly find the content the user wants, avoid driving distractions, and make driving safer. Currently, most car machines are equipped with voice assistants, which have become a standard feature of car machines.

##### 2.4.3 Reduce psychological load
The psychological pressure that users experience due to certain reasons when processing tasks is called psychological load. Mental load will prevent users from successfully completing tasks, so reducing mental load can improve task completion rates.

**Reduce user anxiety:** Common methods for relieving anxiety on mobile phones include loading progress feedback, the number of people waiting in line... In driving scenarios, for example, when users have driving problems or major accidents occur, the system should provide encouragement and solutions to alleviate user anxiety.

#### 2.5 New HMI Solution
1.Design a simple and intuitive interface with a standardized user interaction model to reduce the potential for driver distraction.

2.Emphasize the development of shared HMI rules to resolve confusion caused by different solutions on the market and promote standardized design.

3.Adopt dark mode. According to research, dark UI is more suitable in automotive environments.

4.Integrate brand cultural elements to ensure that HMI design is integrated with the car brand, strengthen the brand image, and make HMI the key to vehicle software solutions.

5.Emphasizing that HMI is not just an attraction, but one of the key elements of the entire vehicle software solution, builds trust between the system and the driver, and adopts HMI human-computer interaction design to ensure a more effective interactive experience in the automotive environment.

We can get a solution just like the following picture.In this solution, its overall design complies with all the above HMI design guidelines. First, in terms of design elements, it has been extremely simplified while being as functionally complete as possible. We can see that the column on the left is the function bar of the car, including driving status, navigation, music, car settings and home page. The column below is the air-conditioning settings. Five buttons and two draggable bars can meet the most basic air-conditioning use. Then, we adopted dark mode to complete the HMI design. On the homepage, we have maintained the consistency of the overall style, whether it is the size of each component or the rounded corners and shadow design.

### Part 3: Evaluation Plan and Expected Results

#### 3.1 Evaluation Plan
To solve the problem of driver confusion and misunderstanding of automated systems due to non-standardized interfaces and symbols, our proposed solution is to implement a standardized HMI design framework. This framework will establish guidelines for the design of HMI systems for autonomous vehicles, including the use of standardized symbols and interfaces.

To evaluate the effectiveness of the solution, we can develop a test and evaluation plan. The program will involve conducting user studies to assess the usability and effectiveness of a standardized HMI design framework and will involve a sample of drivers with experience in both conventional and autonomous vehicles.

Additionally, the study will be conducted in a controlled environment (such as a driving simulator) to ensure participant safety. Participants will be asked to perform a series of tasks using the HMI system of an autonomous vehicle. These tasks are designed to test the usability and effectiveness of a standardized HMI design framework.

Several variables will be the focus of this study, including the time required to complete the task, the number of errors made, and participants' subjective ratings of the usability and effectiveness of the automotive HMI system. The data collected after the survey will be analyzed using scientific statistical methods to determine the effectiveness of the standardized HMI design framework.

#### 3.2  Expected Results
The standardized framework aims to enhance the usability and effectiveness of autonomous automotive HMIs by reducing confusion and frustration through standardized symbols. The organized information layout minimizes cognitive load, improving drivers' ability to monitor automated systems.

The study's insights into specific aspects of the standardized framework's effectiveness will inform refinements, enhancing overall efficacy.

In summary, the proposed standardized HMI design framework holds promise in mitigating driver confusion in automated systems. The test and evaluation program anticipates providing valuable insights, fostering safer and more efficient collaboration between human drivers and autonomous vehicles.
